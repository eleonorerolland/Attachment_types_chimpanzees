# Running the code in R Studio and Spyder Python #

## Installation 

We performed the following analyses using R Studio (R version 4.2.2) and Spyder Python (version 3.9).

To install:

- R Studio (R version 4.2.2): https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.2/ (exe file in the folder)

- Spyder Python (version 3.9): https://docs.spyder-ide.org/3/installation.html, included in Anaconda Python

- Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/


Follow the instructions on the website to install the sofwares. The installation time should be less than 5 minutes.

## Instruction to run the data in R Studio

1. Open R Studio

2. Click on File (in the tool bar), Open file. It will open a window with folders. Go to the folder where the R script is and click on the R script (Open). Now the script is loaded into the R console.

3. Set up the working directory: Session --> Set Working directory --> Choose Directory, then go to the folder where the input files are and click on Open.

4. Install packages and load them: go the the row where the code includes "install.packages" and "library" and do Ctrl R do load the code.

5. To load each row do Ctrl R.

All analysis and Models are named similarly than in the manuscript.


## Instruction to run the data in Spyder (this script should be run when you reach the row 657 in the R script)

1. Open Spyder

2. Click on File (in the tool bar), Open. It will open a window with folders. Go to the folder where the Python script is and click on the Python script (Open). Now the script is loaded into the Python console.

3. Do do not need to set up a working directory. Just run the code row (rows 11-12) with the folder after copy pat the path of the folder in you computer. The instructions are in the script.

4. To load the code, select the row and click on the I with a triangle at the top of the screen.


All datasets used to do the analyses are attached with this file.
All expected output are in the Result section of the manuscript or in the file "Expected output".
All expected run time should be under 5 minutes except for Model 2 (15 minutes).

## Reproduction instructions

Information to reproduce the results are present in the section Material and Method of the manuscript.
